# üêù #BeeWell delivery by Kailo in Northern Devon

As part of Kailo, we are piloting a local adaptation of the #BeeWell survey with schools in North Devon and Torridge in 2023/24.

This organisation contains code used to produce dashboards presenting #BeeWell survey results:
* Dashboards for schools who completed the standard survey
* Dashboards for schools who completed the symbol survey
* Public dashboard presenting results from pupils across the area
